Command line interface written in [Go](https://golang.org/) for the task of using [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/) to download playlists from Youtube as if they were albums.

Depends on [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/) being available in your path.

## From the directory you'd like the files to be downloaded to.

```
$ go run main.go
```
